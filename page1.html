<p style="color:white; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">For 16 years, I have been going to my friends house eveyr year for 2 weeks. We met when we were all 1.<br> We were planning to meet this week, but had to move it back due 
  Covid and all the riots. We pushed it bakc to June and it is just making me want to see them more. Its the best time when we are all together, we have so much fun. <br>Since we had to push it back all of us are dying 
  to see each other. That is one thing I am very excited about.
